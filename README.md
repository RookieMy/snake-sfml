# Snake – Grid-Based Gameplay Experiment (C++ / SFML)

A lightweight Snake clone developed in C++ using SFML.

This project was created as a hobby experiment to explore low-level gameplay programming without relying on a game engine.

## Note

This project was created as an experiment to evaluate AI-assisted development workflows.

I focused on reviewing, debugging, and integrating the generated code while analyzing the quality of AI-produced gameplay logic.
(I treat AI as an iteration and validation tool rather than a source of truth.
Core system design, constraints, and final implementation decisions are always human-driven.)

## Experiment Goal

- Evaluate AI-generated code quality  
- Identify common architectural weaknesses  
- Test debugging workflows  
- Analyze gameplay logic produced by AI

## Focus Areas

- Grid-based movement system  
- Real-time input handling  
- Collision detection  
- Game loop architecture  
- Score tracking  

## Why This Project?

While most of my work focuses on engine-based development (Unity), this project demonstrates my ability to implement core gameplay systems from scratch using native C++.

It reflects my interest in understanding the underlying mechanics of interactive systems rather than relying solely on engine abstractions.

## Controls

Arrow Keys → Move  
R → Restart  

## Requirements

- SFML  
- Visual Studio (recommended)
